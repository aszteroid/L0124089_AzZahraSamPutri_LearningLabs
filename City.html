                Chefchaouen, often called the "Blue City," is a charming town nestled in the Rif Mountains of northern Morocco. 
                Known for its bright blue-painted buildings and narrow cobbled streets, Chefchaouen offers a serene atmosphere 
                and breathtaking beauty. The blue color is believed to have spiritual significance for the locals, while also 
                serving as a cooling agent, mosquito deterrent, or simply a soothing aesthetic for the town.

                Beyond its vibrant hues, Chefchaouen is known for its authentic medina, where local artisans sell handmade crafts, 
                textiles, and traditional souvenirs. The city is surrounded by stunning natural landscapes, including hiking trails 
                that showcase spectacular mountain and valley views, making it a popular destination for travelers and photographers
